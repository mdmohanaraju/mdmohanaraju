## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, Iâ€™m Mohanraj Devadoss. Iâ€™m a tester by profession and an automation developer by passion, with over a decade of experience in both fields.
Iâ€™m a night owl; I find that Iâ€™m most productive after 9 PM. My happiest moments are spent with my family and when Iâ€™m creating new things.
I have a deep love for automation, and I see my contribution as an extension of that passion. I aim to make my work easy to follow and inspiring for others who want to learn.

Happy Learning!!! Happy Automating!!!
